- Navigate to the project folder:
  - cd Trading-View-Tools-Suite
- Install dependencies (if your setup includes Node tooling or build steps):
  - npm install
  - or yarn install
- Start a local development server (if included):
  - npm run start

Note on official releases
- For the latest official releases and updates, check the Releases tab on the repository page. If you’re looking for packaged assets or versioned examples, the Releases section is the right place to look.

Quick start: embedding TradingView widgets
TradingView widgets can be embedded using their official script and a container element. This quick guide shows a safe pattern you can adapt.

- Include the widget script in your page head or just before the closing body tag:
  - <script src="https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js"></script>
- Create a container in your HTML where the chart will render:
  - <div id="tradingview-chart"></div>
- Initialize the widget with a simple configuration:
  - var widget = new TradingView.widget({
      container_id: "tradingview-chart",
      width: 980,
      height: 610,
      symbol: "NASDAQ:AAPL",
      interval: "D",
      theme: "Dark",
      style: "1",
      toolbar_bg: "#f1f3f6",
      locale: "en",
      disabled_features: ["use_localstorage_for_settings"],
    });
- Notes
  - Use official data sources and ensure you comply with rate limits and terms of service.
  - Adjust width, height, symbol, and interval to fit your dashboard layout.
  - The widget configuration shown above is a starting point. You can extend it with additional options as documented by TradingView.

Configuring and extending
- Project-wide configuration
  - config.json (example)
    - {
        "defaultSymbol": "NASDAQ:AAPL",
        "defaultInterval": "D",
        "theme": "Dark",
        "layout": "grid",
        "refreshIntervalSeconds": 60
      }
- Extending with tiny helpers
  - Small utility scripts to format dates, fetch synthetic data, or adapt widget options for different screen sizes.
- Theming and styling
  - Use CSS variables to harmonize widget colors with your dashboard.
  - For dark mode, set the TradingView theme to Dark and ensure contrast is accessible.
- Data sources
  - Prefer official or public APIs with documented terms of use.
  - When using sample data, ensure it’s clearly labeled as synthetic or example data.

Troubleshooting
- If widgets fail to render, check that the script tag loads correctly and that the container element exists in the DOM.
- Verify network access to TradingView resources and ensure there are no conflicting CSS rules that hide the widget container.
- Review the browser console for errors and consult the docs for the exact widget options.

Frequently asked questions
- Do I need a paid TradingView license to use widgets on a personal dashboard?
  - Not for basic embedding, but paid licenses may offer extended features and data access. Always review the latest official terms.
- Can I use real-time data in a personal project?
  - Validate data sources and licensing terms. Use official data feeds and comply with rate limits.
- How do I customize the chart appearance?
  - Use the widget options to set theme, color, and layout. Consult official docs for advanced customization.

Inline snippets and quick references
- Embedding a widget is straightforward with the given script and a container.
- For more complex dashboards, combine multiple widget instances in a responsive grid layout and manage state with lightweight JavaScript utilities.

Advanced topics
- Data fusion: combining TradingView widgets with other compliant data feeds to create richer dashboards.
- Performance: lazy-load widgets as they come into view to improve initial load times.
- Accessibility: ensure contrast and keyboard navigation work well with charts.

This README outlines a legitimate approach to using TradingView tools within a compliant, educational, or personal-project context.
